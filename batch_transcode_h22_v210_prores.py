*** THIS SCRIPT MUST RUN WITH SHELL SCRIPT LAUNCH TO PASS FILES TO SYS.ARGV[1] AND DRIVE PARALLEL ***
Script that takes V210 Matroska files and encodes to ProRes mov:

1. Shell script searches in paths for files that end in '.mov' not modified in the last ten minutes and at a depth of 1 folder,
   then passes any found one at a time to batch_transcode_h22_v210_prores.py
2. Python script receives single path as sys.argv[1] and populates fullpath variable
3. Populates FFmpeg subprocess command based on supplied fullpath, new generated output_fullpath and fixed FFmpeg command.*
4. Transcodes new file into 'prores_transcode/' folder named as {filename}.mov
5. Runs mediaconch checks against the ProRes file
   - If pass:
      i. Moves ProRes to finished_prores/ folder
      ii. Deletes original V210 mov file (currently offline)
   - If fails:
      i. Moves ProRes mov to failures/ folder and appends failures log
      ii. Deletes ProRes from failures folder (currently offline)
     iii. Leaves original V210 mov for repeated encoding attempt

*Note:  There may need to be adjustments to the fixed command in time if this ‘one command fits all’ approach
is found to be lacking. For example -flags +ildct may not be the best option for all interlacing/progressive
files where found. If this is the case then additional mediainfo metadata enquiries will be added to ensure
a customised command is provided.
